What is the difference between Agile and traditional models?

Agile v Waterfall

Waterfall is a more traditional approach where the end result is clearly established from the beginning and there was no room for changes.
This can be a problem with the end product not being of value by the time its available which will cost businesses and waste time and effort.

Scrum artifacts are a collection of information used by a scrum team to define the product or service being developed,
it helps the scrum team to operate more efficiently, it's important for everyone in the team to have access and visibility.

How Can We Effectively Gather Requirements?

Some examples of ways we gather requirements are

- Interviews
- Questioner + Surveys
- User Observation
- Document Analysis
- Workshops
- Brainstorming
- Role-Play
- Use Case and Scenarios
- Focus Groups
- Prototyping

The way we use Trello could be one example of how we gather our requirements,
We also have daily standup which is another example, 
and also with observations, reviews and feedback.

Why? 
Gathering requirements set project goals and act as a guide through testing and development,
wrong or incomplete requirements can create poor user acceptance, increase costs, project delays and possible project failure.
